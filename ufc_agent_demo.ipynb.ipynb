      "### Upset Potential Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "This matchup has several factors that suggest meaningful upset potential:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Momentum Contrast\n",
      "- **Volkanovski** is coming off back-to-back losses (to Topuria and Makhachev), having lost 3 of his last 5 fights\n",
      "- **Lopes** is riding an impressive 5-fight win streak with victories over elite competition (Ortega, Ige, Yusuff)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Stylistic Factors\n",
      "- Lopes has significant height (5'11\" vs 5'6\") and slight reach advantages (72\" vs 71\")\n",
      "- Lopes is a submission specialist (2.8 submissions attempted per 15 minutes) which could be dangerous against Volkanovski who has been finished by submission before\n",
      "- Lopes' recent win over Brian Ortega demonstrates his ability to defeat high-level grapplers\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Areas of Concern for the Champion\n",
      "- Volkanovski is 36 years old and may be showing signs of decline after consecutive losses\n",
      "- His takedown defense (70%) could be tested against an opportunistic submission artist\n",
      "- The psychological impact of recent defeats might affect his confidence\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why Volkanovski Remains Favored\n",
      "- Superior striking volume (6.16 vs 4.20 SLpM) and accuracy (56% vs 53%)\n",
      "- Better defensive striking (58% defense vs 50%)\n",
      "- More consistent wrestling ability (1.78 takedowns per 15 min vs 0.50)\n",
      "- Vastly more championship experience\n",
      "\n",
      "This fight presents legitimate upset potential given Lopes' momentum, size advantages, and submission threats paired with Volkanovski's recent setbacks. While Volkanovski remains one of the most technically sound fighters in UFC history, the combination of age, recent losses, and Lopes' surging career trajectory creates a scenario where an upset is distinctly possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "## UFC 314: Alexander Volkanovski (c) vs. Diego Lopes - Featherweight Title\n",
      "**Date:** April 12, 2025 | **Location:** Miami, Florida\n",
      "\n",
      "This matchup does present significant upset potential for several compelling reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Lopes Could Pull the Upset:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Momentum Shift:** Volkanovski has lost 3 of his last 5 fights, including back-to-back losses to Topuria and Makhachev. Meanwhile, Lopes is riding an impressive 5-fight win streak with notable victories over Brian Ortega, Dan Ige, and Sodiq Yusuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Physical Advantages:** Lopes holds a substantial 5-inch height advantage (5'11\" vs. 5'6\") and a slight reach advantage (72\" vs. 71\"), which could disrupt Volkanovski's usual range control.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Submission Threat:** Lopes attempts 2.8 submissions per 15 minutes, presenting a constant finishing threat. Volkanovski's takedown defense (70%) is good but not elite, potentially giving Lopes opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Age Factor:** At 36 years old (by fight time) and after several wars, Volkanovski may be facing the natural decline that comes with age, while Lopes (30) is in his athletic prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Champion's Advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the upset potential, Volkanovski remains dangerous with:\n",
      "- Superior striking output (6.16 vs. 4.20 strikes landed per minute)\n",
      "- Better striking defense (58% vs. 50%)\n",
      "- More consistent takedown game (1.78 vs. 0.50 takedowns per 15 minutes)\n",
      "- Championship experience\n",
      "\n",
      "This title fight has genuine upset potential given the champion's recent setbacks, the challenger's momentum, and the stylistic challenges Lopes presents. If Volkanovski can't recapture his earlier form, Lopes has the skills and physical tools to become the new featherweight champion.\n",
